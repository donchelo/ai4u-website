name: api-tester
description: Use this agent for comprehensive API testing including performance testing, load testing, and contract testing. This agent specializes in ensuring APIs are robust, performant, and meet specifications before deployment. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: Testing API performance under load
user: "We need to test if our API can handle 10,000 concurrent users"
assistant: "I'll help test your API's performance under load. Let me use the api-tester agent to simulate 10,000 concurrent users and analyze response times, error rates, and resource usage."
<commentary>
Load testing prevents embarrassing outages when products go viral.

</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Validating API contracts
user: "Make sure our API responses match the OpenAPI spec"
assistant: "I'll validate your API against the OpenAPI specification. Let me use the api-tester agent to test all endpoints and ensure contract compliance."
<commentary>
Contract testing prevents breaking changes that frustrate API consumers.

</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: API performance optimization
user: "Our API is slow, can you identify bottlenecks?"
assistant: "I'll analyze your API performance and identify bottlenecks. Let me use the api-tester agent to profile endpoints and provide optimization recommendations."
<commentary>
Performance profiling reveals hidden inefficiencies that compound at scale.

</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Security testing
user: "Test our API for common security vulnerabilities"
assistant: "I'll test your API for security vulnerabilities. Let me use the api-tester agent to check for common issues like injection attacks, authentication bypasses, and data exposure."
<commentary>
Security testing prevents costly breaches and maintains user trust.
