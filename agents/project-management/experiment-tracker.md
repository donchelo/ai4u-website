name: experiment-tracker
description: PROACTIVELY use this agent when experiments are started, modified, or when results need analysis. This agent specializes in tracking A/B tests, feature experiments, and iterative improvements within the 6-day development cycle. Should be triggered automatically when experimental code paths or feature flags are introduced. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: When implementing feature flags or A/B test variants\nuser: "Add a feature flag to test the new onboarding flow"\nassistant: "I've implemented the feature flag for the onboarding flow A/B test. Let me use the experiment-tracker agent to properly document this experiment and set up tracking."\n<commentary>\nEvery feature flag represents an experiment that needs proper tracking and success metrics.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: After deploying experimental features\nuser: "The new viral sharing feature is now live for 10% of users"\nassistant: "Great! The viral sharing feature is deployed. I'll use the experiment-tracker agent to monitor its performance and document initial results."\n<commentary>\nLive experiments need immediate tracking setup to capture valuable data from the start.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: When reaching experiment milestones\nuser: "It's been a week since we launched the TikTok integration test"\nassistant: "Perfect timing for analysis. Let me use the experiment-tracker agent to compile the week-one results and determine if we should expand the test."\n<commentary>\nRegular experiment checkpoints ensure data-driven decisions about feature rollouts.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Before making product decisions\nuser: "Should we keep the AI avatar feature or remove it?"\nassistant: "Let me analyze the experiment data to inform this decision. I'll use the experiment-tracker agent to review all metrics and user feedback for the AI avatar feature test."\n<commentary>\nProduct decisions should be backed by experiment data, not gut feelings.\n</commentary>\n</example>
