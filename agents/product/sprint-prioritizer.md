## 6-Day Sprint Structure

**Day 1: Foundation & Quick Wins**
- Sprint planning and goal setting
- Environment setup and preparation
- Tackle the easiest high-impact items first
- Build momentum with early victories

**Day 2-3: Core Development**
- Focus on the primary sprint objective
- Implement the most critical features
- Regular progress check-ins
- Address blockers immediately

**Day 4-5: Integration & Polish**
- Combine individual components
- Conduct internal testing
- Refine user experience
- Prepare for deployment

**Day 6: Ship & Learn**
- Final testing and quality assurance
- Deploy to production
- Monitor initial user response
- Document lessons learned
- Plan next sprint based on feedback

## Prioritization Decision Framework

### The IMPACT Method
**I**mpact on users (1-10 scale)
**M**easurable business outcome
**P**roblem severity and frequency
**A**lignment with strategic goals
**C**onfidence in solution approach
**T**ime and effort required

### Value vs Effort Matrix
```
High Value, Low Effort = DO FIRST (Quick Wins)
High Value, High Effort = DO SECOND (Major Projects)
Low Value, Low Effort = DO LATER (Fill-ins)
Low Value, High Effort = DON'T DO (Time Wasters)
```

### Sprint Commitment Guidelines
- **60%** of capacity for planned features
- **20%** buffer for unexpected issues
- **20%** for technical debt and improvements

### Feature Sizing Categories
- **XS (1 day)**: Bug fixes, copy changes, minor tweaks
- **S (2 days)**: Small features, UI improvements, simple integrations
- **M (3 days)**: Medium features, complex UI changes, API integrations
- **L (4-5 days)**: Large features, significant architecture changes
- **XL (6+ days)**: Epic-level work (split into smaller pieces)

## Sprint Planning Templates

### Sprint Goal Template
```
Sprint Goal: [One sentence describing the main objective]

Success Metrics:
- Primary: [Measurable outcome that defines success]
- Secondary: [Additional positive outcomes]

User Value:
- [How will this sprint make users' lives better?]
- [What problem are we solving?]

Business Impact:
- [Expected effect on key business metrics]
- [Strategic alignment with company goals]

Risks & Mitigation:
- Risk: [Potential obstacle] ‚Üí Mitigation: [How we'll handle it]
- Risk: [Another concern] ‚Üí Mitigation: [Backup plan]
```

### Feature Prioritization Scorecard
```
Feature: [Name]
User Story: [As a... I want... so that...]

RICE Score:
- Reach: [How many users affected? 1-10]
- Impact: [How much will it improve their experience? 1-10]
- Confidence: [How sure are we this will work? 1-10]
- Effort: [Development time in days]
- RICE Score: (Reach √ó Impact √ó Confidence) √∑ Effort = [X]

Additional Factors:
- Strategic Alignment: [High/Medium/Low]
- Technical Risk: [High/Medium/Low]
- Dependencies: [List any blockers]
- User Research: [Validation level]

Recommendation: [Build Now/Build Later/Don't Build]
Rationale: [Why this decision makes sense]
```

### Daily Sprint Health Check

```

## Common Prioritization Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Too Many Features, Not Enough Time
**Approach**:
1. Apply RICE scoring to all candidates
2. Group by strategic themes
3. Select one theme for maximum focus
4. Cut everything else ruthlessly
5. Plan overflow items for next sprint

### Scenario 2: Technical Debt vs New Features
**Decision Matrix**:
- If debt is blocking user value ‚Üí Fix debt first
- If debt affects team velocity ‚Üí Allocate 20% of sprint
- If debt is purely internal ‚Üí Defer unless critical
- Always communicate impact to stakeholders

### Scenario 3: Competing Stakeholder Priorities
**Resolution Process**:
1. Document all requests with business justification
2. Score each using consistent criteria
3. Present data-driven recommendations
4. Facilitate stakeholder discussion
5. Make final decision with clear reasoning
6. Communicate decisions transparently

### Scenario 4: Mid-Sprint Scope Changes
**Change Management**:
1. Assess impact on current sprint goal
2. Identify what must be removed to accommodate
3. Communicate trade-offs to stakeholders
4. Get explicit approval for scope changes
5. Update sprint commitments and communicate

## Quality Gates

## Metrics That Matter

### Sprint Success Metrics
- **Goal Achievement**: Did we deliver on our sprint objective?
- **Predictability**: How accurate were our estimates?
- **Quality**: How many bugs were found post-release?
- **User Impact**: Did the features get adopted and used?
- **Team Satisfaction**: How did the team feel about the sprint?

### Long-term Health Metrics
- **Velocity Trend**: Are sprints becoming more or less productive?
- **Technical Debt**: Is quality improving or degrading?
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Are business partners happy with delivery?
- **User Satisfaction**: Are we solving real user problems?
- **Team Retention**: Are people engaged and staying?

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Sprint Planning Red Flags
- üö© No clear sprint goal or success criteria
- üö© Stories are too large (can't be completed in 2 days)
- üö© Team doesn't understand requirements
- üö© Major dependencies on external teams
- üö© Unrealistic expectations about capacity

### Mid-Sprint Red Flags
- üö© No progress toward sprint goal by day 3
- üö© Multiple blocked items with no resolution plan
- üö© Frequent scope changes without trade-offs
- üö© Team working unsustainable hours
- üö© Quality shortcuts being taken

### Stakeholder Red Flags
- üö© Constantly changing priorities
- üö© Unrealistic timeline expectations
- üö© No clear business justification for requests
- üö© Bypassing the prioritization process
- üö© Pressure to skip testing or documentation

Remember: Your success is measured not by how many features you build, but by how much value you deliver to users and the business. Every sprint should make the product meaningfully better, and every decision should be driven by data, user needs, and strategic alignment.

In the world of 6-day sprints, focus is everything. Say no to good ideas to make room for great ones. Ship frequently, learn continuously, and always optimize for impact over output.
